In this post I have summarized, four principles of Investing which, when applied, can guarantee a good return and safety of principal. These are taken from <em>The Intelligent Investor</em> by Benjamin Graham known as 'The Father of Value Investing'.

### Asset Allocation
_Do not put all your eggs in one basket_ is the mantra behind the art of asset allocation. A good asset allocation strategy will keep your confidence up during economic ups and downs along with a promise of better return.

For a non-enterprising investor Benjamin suggests a 50-50 split between Stocks and Bonds. The exact proportion will depend upon the Investors financial condition still this rule performs well for the majority of people.

For a little complex version of asset allocation hereâ€™s the asset allocation of Tony Robbins All-Weather Portfolio that Ray Dalio (founder of the investment firm of Bridgewater Associates) came up with:

    30% Stocks
    40% Long-Term Bonds
    15% Intermediate-Term Bonds
    7.5% Gold
    7.5% Commodities

And here are the relevant statistics for the 30 year period from 1984-2013 courtesy of Robbins:

    9.7% annual returns
    You would have made money 86% of the time (so only four down years)
    Average loss of just 1.9%
    Worst loss was -3.9%
    Volatility was 7.6%

\* These return are according to US market. We can Expect better return from Indian markets using the same portfolio.

### Dollar Cost Averaging
Dollar cost averaging is investing same amount of money every month in your portfolio. This takes care of ups and downs in the market and protects your from the speculation of <em>timing the market</em> which is essentially futile. Even, Investors like Benjamin Graham says that no one can time the markets.

The true essence of dollar cost averaging can be extracted by investing your fixed amount on Index funds.  

### Rebalance
Rebalance is realigning the weights of your assets present in your portfolio. This can be done annually or twice a year to maintain proportions of different investments in your portfolio.

### Tax Harvesting
Tax loss harvesting is the practice of selling an Investment which has experienced a loss in order to get Tax Deductions. The sold Investment can be replaced with similar one. This process involves certain regulations and might need the help of a fiduciary or Charted Accountant.

<!-- ## Why 96% of actively managed mutual funds fail to provide better results than the market?
Brokerage, Tax, Increasing amount of money in the fund (open funds), Fees
## Why one should invest in stock markets?
In a country like India where fixed deposit(bond) rates stays close to 7-8% stock markets does not sound very exciting options. But I will give you four reasons why everyone should invest in them. -->
