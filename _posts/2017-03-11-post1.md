Just like every other techie who has no relation with the world of finances, working towards managing my own finances was not there at all in my list of priorities. But a chain of events forced me to dive into the field. To my surprise I am presently writing this blogpost on topic which I never expected.

> Do not work for the money, let the money work for you.

The aforementioned quote from _Rich Dad, Poor Dad_ made me to dive into the world of finances. Though, I was inspired by the book to learn about managing my money, I struggled a lot initially where to start with. So this blogpost is all about the basic questions with which I struggled before getting started.

## Why should I learn to manage my finances?
If someone tells you to give less than half an hour a day in return of the following:
* Never have to worry about losing your day job
* A better lifestyle
* A guarantee of retirement earlier than your friends

Would you agree to give that someone your half an hour a day?

I would happily if there is not *conditions apply associated with it.

That someone is your finances.

## How to start with managing your own finances?
The first and foremost important point in the whole process is fixing a percentage of your earning towards you Investments(Yes, not savings)

### Now you have got money to Invest but you don't know what to do with that money?

Benjamin Graham, one of the greates investor recommends splitting your investments equally into Bonds and Stocks. This approach helps in balacing your porfolio towards market risk and gains. For more details on Investments and Portfolio managment have a look at this. 

To get a hand of stock markets one can open a demat account. I opened a demat account at Zerodah mainly because of its easy to use user interface.
* Best way to own the a complete market for a passive investor is to invest in Index Funds
Why to take risk on Stocks when you can get good return on your fixed deposits?
Fixed depsits are very popular options for common man due to its low risk factors but consider the follwoing points:
* Low returns of about 8-9 %
* Inflation can negate your fixed deposits (risk does not sound imminent to most people which is why people buy FD's)
* They are Taxable
* Premature Closure leads to losses

## Investmenst vs Speculation
<!-- When one of my relatives lost his job and all the money in 2008 market crash **Stock Market** became synonymous to **Gambling** for me.
 -->
An investment operation is one which, upon thorough analysis promises safety of principle and an adequate return. Operation not meeting these requirements are speculative. Invesor should be able to keep his investments atleast for an year without worrying about vicissitudes of the market. 


### Inflation
<!-- Now you will say that sounds good on paper but people loose money all the time -->

<!-- What is the difference between Stocks, Bonds and Fixed Deposits?


 	     | Bonds       | Fixed Deposits | Stocks |
 ------- | :---------: | :------------: |:-----------:|
Safety   |  | Highly Safe    |Market Risk|
Liquidity|			   | Penalty for Premature Closure| Very Liquid|
Returns  | 8-9% | 	10-12% | 12-18% \*|
Tenure   | 
Availability| On Tap | Stock Exchange | Stock Exchanges
